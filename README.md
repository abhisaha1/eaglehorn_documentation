Eaglehorn Documentation
=======================

You can read the documentation online here - http://eaglehorn.org

The purpose of source controlling the documentation is to help you understand how Eaglehorn can be used
to create any application. You can browse through the source code.

Concepts:
=========

Public - This is the start folder. You should point the server document root to this folder. This
allows you to make your application files inaccessible directly.

Config - This contains the configuration of your application.

Start - This contains the autoload file which loads necessary files to fireup your application.
